Given the roots of two binary trees ```p``` and``` q```, write a function to check if they are the same or not.

Two binary trees are considered the same if they are structurally identical, and the nodes have the same value.

## Example 1:

```
Input: p = [1,2,3], q = [1,2,3]
Output: true
```
## Example 2:

```
Input: p = [1,2], q = [1,null,2]
Output: false
```
## Example 3:

```
Input: p = [1,2,1], q = [1,1,2]
Output: false
 ```
 
 ## Constraints:
```
The number of nodes in both trees is in the range [0, 100].
-104 <= Node.val <= 104
```
